# English PyBar Bot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grupy-sanca/english-pybar-bot.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grupy-sanca/english-pybar-bot)

## What
Bot created to generate conversation topics for our English-hosted PyBares.

## Why
grupy-sanca is a Python User Group from SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil, and we host meetups
in English at the bar to help our members improve their English conversation
skills, aided by beer and good company.

## How to use
First clone the repository then `cd` inside.
Then install dependencies, enter virtualenv and install pre-commit
```
$ pipenv install -d
$ pipenv shell
(venv) $ pre-commit install
```
pre-commit is used to ensure every commit is tested against the current
code conventions.

The local.env has the basic ENV list for the bot to work
```
cp local.env .env
```
then edit .env with the correct values.

### To run the tests, run:
```
(venv) $ pytest
```
After each new feature make sure to write tests for that feature.
